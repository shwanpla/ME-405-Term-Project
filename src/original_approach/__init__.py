"""
Original state-space observer approach with IMU fusion.

This package contains the original navigation implementation that combined
encoder-derived wheel velocities with IMU-derived absolute heading using
RK4 numerical integration.

Note: This implementation was replaced by the displacement-based odometry
approach. See the Analysis documentation for details.
